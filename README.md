This project was built using HTML with the SASS extension of CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript, based on the Figma file available at https://www.figma.com/file/zjHt1CwKAbCWWif5eyeDAv/Challenge-%231?node-id=6-22&t=aca77VaNxsRAFNOZ-0. The Figma file was provided as a challenge by a programming school "Project Classroom". In this project, I showcased my skills in creating a simple webpage based on a Figma design.
